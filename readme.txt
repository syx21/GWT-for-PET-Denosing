INSTALLATION:
- This code requires to have the Graph Signal Processing Toolbox(GSP box) and
 sgwt_toolbox-1.02(SGWT box) installed, which can be freely downloaded
 from https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/ and  http://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt.

- Once these packages have their corresponding mex files compiled 
(check their instructions for further details), make sure they are added in
the Matlab path.

USAGE:
The main function is M_GWTdenoising_demo.m, which performs GWT denoising for PET with MRI
method in BrainWeb Phanom data.
